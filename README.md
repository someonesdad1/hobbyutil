Click [here](./project_list.html) to go to the projects page to read their
descriptions and download them.  

This repository is for projects I've developed over the years for my
various hobbies.  Each project is a link which you can click on to get the
file(s) associated with the project.  If you would like the source
documents (usually constructed from an Open Office document), email me at
someonesdad1@gmail.com and I'll send you a zip file containing the source.

I test the python scripts using python 3.6.  If you see a script contain
the line

```from __future__ import division, print_function```

then it's probable that the script will run under python 2.7.

The hu.py script is used to populate the repository's files from the files
on my hard disk.  The projects file is used as a data file to instruct the
python script where to get the needed files.

Archival
========

This is the third website that I have hosted this stuff on and I'm sure it
won't be the last.  My wish is that I could just leave it in one place and
be confident that it would remain available to interested folks for a few
decades, even after I'm dead.  But that's just not going to happen because
a few years is a long time on the web.  Who can foresee what will happen to
Github a few years down the road after Microsoft purchases it?  I don't
have a good solution to this problem.  About the most pragmatic thing that
could happen is that lots of people copy this repository to other places
and share it with other folks.  Feel free to mirror this site if you wish.

If you're interested in archiving your own data on Github, you might want
to read this

Currently, most of the scripts are under the Open Software License version
3.0.  This is a copyleft license; I am contemplating putting everything
under the Apache 2.0 license, which is not a copyleft license.  Regardless,
my basic intent is that this stuff should be free to whomever wants it as
long as they keep the copyright message and clearly mark it as modified if
they change the content.
