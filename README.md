This repository is for projects and documents I've developed over the
years for my various hobbies.  Each project is a link which you can
click on to get the file(s) associated with the project.  I'll often
write a document about a topic new to me to help me learn, something I
know a number of my technical friends do.

Most of the programming stuff is written in python (there's also a
little C and C++ stuff).  Around 2014 I quit writing my python
scripts to work both on python 3 and 2.7; now they're only written for
python 3.6 or later.  If a script has a ```from __future__``` line
then it's probable that the script will run under python 2.7.

Archival
========

This is the third website that I have hosted this stuff on over the last
couple of decades and I'm sure it won't be the last.  My wish is that I
could just leave it in one place and be confident that it would remain
available to interested folks for a few decades, even after I'm dead.
But that's just not going to happen because a few years is a long time
on the web.  Who can foresee what will happen to Github a few years down
the road?  I don't have a good solution to this problem.  About the most
pragmatic thing that could happen is that lots of people copy this
repository to other places and share it with other folks.  Feel free to
mirror this site if you wish.

If you're interested in archiving your own data on Github, you might want
to read a [tutorial](./tutorial.html).

License
=======

Currently, most of the scripts are under the Open Software License version
3.0.  This is a copyleft license; I am contemplating putting everything
under the Apache 2.0 license, which is not a copyleft license.  Regardless,
my basic intent is that this stuff should be free to whomever wants it as
long as they keep the copyright message and clearly mark it as modified if
they change the content.  I don't bother with a copyright message in the
documents, but they are morally under the same license as the software
stuff.
