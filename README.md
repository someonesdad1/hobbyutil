[plib](https://github.com/someonesdad1/plib) contains python modules and
scripts I've written and may contain more up-to-date stuff than this
project.

This repository is for projects and documents I've developed over the
years for my various hobbies.  Each project is a link which you can
click on to get the file(s) associated with the project.  I'll often
write a document about a topic new to me to help me learn, something I
know a number of my technical friends do.

Most of the programming stuff is written in python (there's also a
little C and C++ stuff).  Around 2014 I quit writing my python
scripts to work both on python 3 and 2.7; now they're only written for
python 3.6 or later.  If a script has a ```from __future__``` line
then it's probable that the script will run under python 2.7.

Archival
========

This is the third website that I have hosted this stuff on over the last
few decades (the first two went defunct).  My wish is that I could just
leave it in one place and be confident that it would remain available to
interested folks for a decade or so, even after I'm dead.  But that's not
going to happen because a few years is a long time on the web.  Who can
foresee what will happen to Github a few years down the road?  I don't have
a good solution to this problem.  About the most pragmatic thing that could
happen is that lots of people copy this repository's contents to other
places and share it with other folks.  Feel free to mirror this site if you
wish.

If you're interested in archiving your own data on Github, you might want
to read a [tutorial](./tutorial.html).

As I am chronologically-gifted, this website will disappear after I am no
longer able to maintain it myself.  I'll ask a friend to administer it for
a period time and to add a message that there will be no more changes to
the contents.  I'll ask him to delete the github repository after a
suitable time (it's up to him about what amount of time is suitable).

License
=======

Most of the scripts should under the Open Software License version 3.0.  My
basic intent is that this stuff should be free to whomever wants it as long
as they keep the copyright message and clearly mark it as modified if they
change the content.  I don't bother with a copyright message in the
documents, but they are under the same license as the software stuff by
virtue of this sentence.
