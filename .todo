hobbyutil ToDo list

- Current task
    - Convert projects to projects.py
    - Add a -n option for a dry run
    - When the projects.py data are read in, everything in the structure
      should be validated and converted to P paths.

- Must
    - Clearly describe exactly how all the dependent files are produced.  
    - Add to the project_list.html file that all python scripts in zipfiles
      are to be installed by putting them in a separate directory and that
      other included python files are modules that script depends on.  It
      is suggested you create a separate directory, unzip the zipfile
      there, and run it.  Once you're convinced you want to keep the stuff,
      you'll want to put the needed modules somewhere in your PYTHONPATH so
      they can be found when the script runs.
    - Many of the scripts are things in /plib/pgm
        - Eliminate the overlap.
        - Produce a similar page as https://someonesdad1.github.io/ for
          /plib.  This will make it easier for people to find what they
          want.  Have two separate pages, one for /plib and one for
          /plib/pgm.
        - Consider moving much of this stuff to plib, as this helps to
          centralize all my stuff over time.
- Want
    - The git repository is 100 MB
        - Look at eliminating much of the stuff
    - The generated web page for the project should contain a date to let
      the viewer see the last time the project was updated.  This could be
      done by giving the key file in the list a '+' character to flag that
      its timestamp should be gotten.
    - manufy.py doesn't work correctly when it's -h output is manufy'd: the
      newlines in the quoted lines should be changed to double backslashes.
    - seg.py isn't working yet.
    - refcards:  Need to generate all new PDFs in PDF/A form.
    - mass.py should allow a # character in a string.
    - cheat:  Need to generate all new PDFs in PDF/A form.
    - elements:  get working under python 3.  Current problem is crappiness
      of GSview, not python.
    - /science/phasors/phasors.odt needs writing & inclusion
- Documentation
    - For each description of a project, add a sentence why someone might
      want to use the item.
