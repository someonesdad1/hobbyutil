    It's a bit clunky having a python script do the work.  I'd like to
    reflect on constructing a makefile to build the desired packages, as
    that's its forte.  The hu script does keep from updating the large
    packages unless it's done manually and that's a desired behavior,
    but a auxiliary script can do that.

    The makefile would automatically keep everything up to date when run
    and identify problems.  What gets checked into get and pushed to the
    server is a secondary task.

    A value-add of the hu.py script is the projects file contains all
    the files that make up a project; these would be used if anyone ever
    wanted the "source" package.  However, this hasn't been needed at
    all, so can probably be done manually if it's ever needed.  The
    simple test I did with the makefile showed that it's easy to
    construct the targets and maintain them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Must
----

    * Need the color.py script and a dummy object to replace it if it's not
      present.
    * For each description of a project, add a sentence why someone might
      want to use the item.
    * oct: Needs to be rather severely edited, as there's quite a bit of
      junk.
    * hu.py:  If the keyword isn't matched, default to 'list'.

Want
----

    * The generated web page for the project should contain a date to let
      the viewer see the last time the project was updated.  This could be
      done by giving the key file in the list a '+' character to flag that
      its timestamp should be gotten.
    * manufy.py doesn't work correctly when it's -h output is manufy'd:  the
      newlines in the quoted lines should be changed to double backslashes.
    * seg.py isn't working yet.
    * refcards:  Need to generate all new PDFs in PDF/A form.
    * mass.py should allow a # character in a string.
    * cheat:  Need to generate all new PDFs in PDF/A form.

Low priority
------------

    * elements:  get working under python 3.  Current problem is crappiness of
      GSview, not python.
    * /science/phasors/phasors.odt needs writing & inclusion
