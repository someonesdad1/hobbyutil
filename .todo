Must
----

    * hu.py
        - For 'list' feature, make stale projects print in color (this
          needs fixes to columnize.py and color.py)
    * For each description of a project, add a sentence why someone might want to
      use the item.
    * oct: Needs to be rather severely edited, as there's quite a bit of junk.
    * loo:  not working

Want
----

    * refcards:  Need to generate all new PDFs in PDF/A form.
    * cheat:  Need to generate all new PDFs in PDF/A form.
    * ds.pdf:  needs to be updated
    * /science/phasors/phasors.odt needs writing & inclusion

Inactive or not worth fixing
----------------------------

    * elements:  get working under python 3.
    * dmath:  doesn't work under python 3.6.1.  I've ignored the overflow
      exceptions; someone else who has the patience can figure out what's
      not working if they wish.
