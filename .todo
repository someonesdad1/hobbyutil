Must
----

    * Need the color.py script and a dummy object to replace it if it's not
      present.
    * For each description of a project, add a sentence why someone might
      want to use the item.
    * oct: Needs to be rather severely edited, as there's quite a bit of
      junk.
    * hu.py:  If the keyword isn't matched, default to 'list'.

Want
----

    * The generated web page for the project should contain a date to let
      the viewer see the last time the project was updated.  This could be
      done by giving the key file in the list a '+' character to flag that
      its timestamp should be gotten.
    * manufy.py doesn't work correctly when it's -h output is manufy'd:  the
      newlines in the quoted lines should be changed to double backslashes.
    * seg.py isn't working yet.
    * refcards:  Need to generate all new PDFs in PDF/A form.
    * mass.py should allow a # character in a string.
    * cheat:  Need to generate all new PDFs in PDF/A form.

Low priority
------------

    * elements:  get working under python 3.  Current problem is crappiness of
      GSview, not python.
    * /science/phasors/phasors.odt needs writing & inclusion
