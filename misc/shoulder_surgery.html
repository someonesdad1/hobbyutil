<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-1">Introduction</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>This document's goal is to acquaint others facing shoulder surgery with
some of the things they might experience.  I'll discuss my routine right
shoulder arthroscopic rotator cuff repair which was needed because of an
injury.  I also had two earlier shoulder surgeries, one for a massive
rotator cuff tear of my left shoulder followed by fixing a fracture in
the upper humerus of that shoulder 3 months after the rotator cuff
repair.</p>
<p>You're probably considering shoulder surgery because of an injury or
degradation due to disease or aging.  For an injury, you probably went to
your family doctor, urgent care, or emergency room and they took x-rays,
put you in a sling, and referred you to an orthopedic surgeon.  For the
chronic condition, you likely went to your family doctor who referred you
to an orthopedic surgeon.</p>
<p>The process of finding an orthopedic surgeon deserves some thought.
Commonly, you'll just use the person recommended by your family doctor or
emergency room.  If you have a non-urgent condition, it could be worth your
time to work on finding the best surgeon for you in your area.</p>
<p>The surgeon will give you his opinions about your treatment choices.  Not
all treatments involve surgery, so you need to decide whether you should
have the surgery or not.</p>
<p>The major steps you'll go through are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Decide whether to have surgery</li>
<li>Preparation for surgery</li>
<li>Surgery</li>
<li>Recovery from surgery</li>
<li>Rehabilitation</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These surgeries were done on me while I was around age 70.  I'm a
fairly active senior and do a lot of do-it-yourself tasks, home and car
maintenance, and yard work.  Having a non-functional shoulder or
significant shoulder pain cramps my lifestyle.  For each of the
surgeries, my decision was that I would be worse off by not having the
surgery.</p>
<p>Consider the experiences in this document as probably typical.  Things
can change substantially depending on your age, health, medical
considerations, etc., so your best strategy is to ask questions of your
surgeon and physical therapist.</p>
<p>The burden is on you as the patient to do the necessary research,
studying, and asking the right questions.  <strong>The ultimate decision
about your treatment is up to you, not the doctor or therapist</strong>.</p>
<p>I feel the best strategy is to find health care professionals whose
opinions you trust and follow their guidance, which will be based on
their experience.</p>

<div class="section" id="cast-of-characters">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-2">Cast of characters</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I've changed the names of the people involved in this document.  These
chosen names are sometimes used when e.g. discussing cryptographic
protocols and have no fundamental hidden meaning.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Alice:    Surgeon who performed my shoulder surgeries</li>
<li>Bob:      My family doctor</li>
<li>Carol:    Physician's assistant for Alice</li>
<li>David:    Alice's nurse</li>
<li>Debbie:   My twin sister, a physical therapist</li>
<li>Eve:      Physical therapist who treated my three surgeries</li>
<li>Frank:    Eve's physical therapy assistant</li>
<li>Jimmy:    One of Bob's nurses</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>My reason for changing the names is so that this document can be used
by any US surgeon or physical therapist to give to patients to help
them understand what they may go through.  The people who treated me
may recognize themselves, but the intent is that this document could
have been written by any patient in the US.  Hopefully, standards of
care are similar enough that what I describe will be close to what you
experience.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-4">Overview</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I've concluded there are three key things involved in the successful
outcome of a shoulder surgery:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Surgeon</li>
<li>Physical therapist</li>
<li>Your commitment to your recovery</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class="section" id="surgeon">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-5">Surgeon</a></h2>
<blockquote>
Of course you'll want a surgeon who is technically good and
compassionate, but it's also important that her coworkers be good too,
as they are a team.  I spent more time talking with the surgeon's
coworkers than the surgeon -- and these coworkers were invaluable.  My
surgeon, Alice, had a PA (physician's assistant) Carol who assists
Alice in all the surgeries.  Most of my appointments were with Carol.
Carol earned my trust the first time I saw her because of the time she
spent with me, the depth of her knowledge, and her explanations of how
the fix would work.  David, Alice's nurse, answered many questions over
the phone and once saved me from making a medication mistake that could
have had life-threatening consequences.  Alice, Carol, and David also
treated my wife's broken humerus (she broke it in a fall similar to the
one I had, except her treatment didn't involve surgery) and my wife
feels the same way about them that I do.</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="physical-therapist">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-6">Physical therapist</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You will spend more time with the physical therapist and her staff than
anyone else involved in your recovery.  I'm fortunate in having a twin
sister Debbie who's an outstanding physical therapist.  Debbie spent
untold hours with me on the phone and in person on a number of visits
to her, helping me over numerous recovery humps, particularly with the
challenging first two surgeries.</p>
<p>In my initial consultation with the surgeon Alice, I asked her for the
best local physical therapist she could recommend, explaining that I
had had some not-so-successful treatments in the past with various PTs
in our city and I was picky because of knowing Debbie's caliber.  Alice
recommended Eve and I stayed with Eve for my three surgery recoveries.
My good therapy outcomes are testaments to Debbie's and Eve's physical
therapy skills.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="commitment">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-7">Commitment</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The importance of your commitment is easy to underestimate.  You may not
appreciate</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How long it will take for you to recover your functionality.</li>
<li>How much work and dedication it will require to do what you are
told.</li>
<li>How hard it is to stay motivated to do these boring exercises.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By my third surgery (the routine rotator cuff repair), I was absolutely
committed to doing exactly what the PT told me, with good form, and with
dedication.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cost">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-8">Cost</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A fourth big thing could be the money involved to pay for the surgery
and therapy.  I've not addressed the issue of money in this document,
but it will be present and may influence your decisions.</p>
<p>Before my first surgery, a neighbor showed me his arm's limitations
after his shoulder surgery (he slipped on ice).  These limitations came
about because he couldn't afford the physical therapy after the
surgery, so he stopped the therapy.  He wound up with a dissappointing
50% functionality at best, although he had learned to live with it.</p>
<p>For my routine rotator cuff surgery, I had 18 PT appointments over
about 4 months (later in my recovery I changed the visits to every 2
weeks).  The insurance copayment with the insurance company we had was
half of what it was for PT for the previous two surgeries.  For the
more challenging massive rotator cuff tear and fracture, I had 61 PT
appointments over slightly more than a year of therapy.  The PT was by
far my largest out-of-pocket expense.</p>
<p>You'd be wise to contact your insurance company before the surgery and
try to learn what's covered and what's not, what your expenses will be,
etc.</p>

<div class="section" id="diagnosis">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-10">Diagnosis</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I assume there are two situations here:  chronic and acute shoulder
problems.  Chronic means you've had long-term disability or pain in your
shoulder.  Acute means you probably injured it.</p>
<p>My right shoulder had chronic low-level pain in it over a decade or more.
Based on discussions with sister Debbie, I assumed this was slow
degradation due to wear, aging, and arthritis.  It was never severe enough
to cause me to seek a solution.  It became more important after I injured
it while trying to turn a wrench on a difficult in-ground water valve.  I
let things sit for a number of months to see if it would improve, but it
didn't.  I chose to have a surgical repair 6 months later when an MRI
showed I had ripped the supraspinatus muscle in half.</p>
<p>The first step of diagnosis is to get a history and to manually examine
your shoulder.  For an acute injury, it is likely an x-ray of the
shoulder will be taken to see whether you have a fracture or not.  Many
people will go to the emergency room for their shoulder injury, but
it's rarely an emergency.  You can go to your family doctor's office or
an urgent care place, even if it takes a wait of a few days.  For a
rotator cuff tear or a fracture, it's common to refer you to an
orthopedic surgeon.</p>
<p>Your family doctor or the surgeon will first want an MRI to see what's
going on if there's no fracture.  A fracture will be dealt with first,
as it's more urgent than a soft-tissue injury.  For a fracture, the
surgeon will likely want a CAT scan.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mri">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-11">MRI</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For soft tissue injuries like rotator cuff problems, MRI (magnetic
resonance imaging) is the standard tool for diagnosing the type and
extent of problem.  From the images the surgeon and his PA have shown
me, these images seem to give more than enough information for them to
plan their surgical approach in detail, including measuring needed
dimensions.</p>
<p>You need to know what to expect from an MRI on your shoulder.  You'll
lay on your back on a movable table that is inserted into a relatively
small tunnel inside a big noisy machine.  Your shoulder will be pressed
into a fixture to hold it still and a strap will be put across your
legs.</p>
<p>Your basic tasks are 1) to lay as still as you can, as any movement
destroys the images and 2) try not to panic from any claustrophobic
feelings while you're in the tunnel.  You're given a rubber bulb to
squeeze if you need to stop the test for any reason, so don't worry
that you won't be able to get out.</p>
<p>If you do stop the test, realize that the beginning of the process
spends some time finding the key anatomical landmarks on your body to
reference all the further measurements.  If you come out of the tunnel
or move, these landmarks can be lost and you have to start all over
again.</p>
<p>In the three MRI procedures I have had, two were for shoulder injuries.
My three MRIs were memorable because I was not able to lay motionless
on my back for long without experiencing growing arm pain caused by my
shoulder injuries.  I had to lie in that tunnel completely motionless
for 20-25 minutes and the pain became significant, to the point where I
kept telling the tech to hurry up because it really hurt.  It caused
significant elbow pain and went all the way down to my hand.  I'm
supposing it was caused by some pressure on a nerve -- and I've
experienced the identical pain from both left and right shoulder
injuries on all three MRIs that I've had.  However, because I didn't
want to have to do the whole thing over again, I toughed it out.  For
my last MRI, I tried to distract myself by counting off the amount of
time the tech told me the next picture was going to take.</p>
<p>For my first MRI, they just put me in the tunnel without telling me
anything and I didn't know what to expect.  I spent the first half of
the time trying to imagine what all the machinery I was hearing was
doing.  About 2/3 the way through the scan, my brain started to worry
about me being trapped and I had some momentary thoughts of
claustrophobia.  I had to force myself to stop worrying and ignore the
pain and tough it out.  The tech of my first MRI messed up by not
telling me what to expect and not making me wear earphones so she could
talk to me every few minutes to tell me the progress.  This would have
been a big help.  I wrote a letter to the hospital suggesting they
change their procedures.</p>
<p>For the next MRI, I decided to take a Valium to reduce the probability
of panic from claustrophobia.  I had a great tech who talked to me and
a mirror to allow me to look down the tunnel behind me at the parking
lot, so I had no problems at all.  This MRI was of my head, but I was
waiting for my first shoulder surgery and I still had the bad shoulder
pain from laying still.</p>
<p>For my third MRI (for the routine rotator cuff injury) I brought a
sedative prescribed by my doctor, but because the MRI folks were ahead
of schedule, I came in early and they whisked me in, so I didn't have
time to take the pill, as it needs about 30 minutes to start working (I
was told not to take it until I got there).  But I didn't need it.
Once again, the shoulder/arm pain was the dominating factor.  I made
sure the tech knew to keep communicating with me and updating the
status (she was great).</p>
<p>From the experience of these three MRI scans with a shoulder injury, if
I have to have another such MRI with a shoulder injury, I will take
some pain pills to dull the arm ache from laying still on my back.
It's significant enough that I would take at least two 5 mg oxycodone
pills, maybe three (the maximum dose) to dull the pain.  However, I'd
make sure the MRI tech knows I've taken the pain pills and helps me
walk to and from the machine, as oxycodone can make you wobbly on your
feet.  I would also bring a cane with me to help me steady myself.  I'd
also have someone drive me, as you're not allowed to drive while on
such opioids.</p>
<p>The MRI results are sent to the surgeon's office and the PA or surgeon
will go over the results with you, showing you the pictures and
describing the diagnosis.  The pictures will look unfamiliar because
you probably haven't seen such things before, but a good PA/doc will
help you understand things by using an anatomical model.  Usually, the
surgeon has enough information to plan his surgical treatment and no
further diagnostic information is needed.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-12">Deciding on surgery</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A surgical treatment for your shoulder problem may be optional.  Even
for my fracture, which had a bone rather badly twisted out of position,
I could have chosen to spend 6 weeks in a special sling and have it
heal without surgery.  The surgeon Alice told me she was on the fence
about whether to operate or use the sling, so she gave me the necessary
information and told me to choose which treatment I wanted.  Since I'm
an active senior, I decided on the surgery because a key x-ray view
looking up the long axis of the humerus showed how much the humeral
head had rotated out of position and I felt the best outcome would be
if things were put back the way they were before.  Both Alice and her
PA Carol told me independently after the surgery that they felt I made
the correct decision, as they know me and my lifestyle.</p>
<p>Common reasons to have the surgery are that you've lost significant
functionality or have ongoing pain.  A factoid is that many autopsies
have shown that people have torn/degraded rotator cuffs and were able
to accommodate and live OK without having things fixed.  Because of
this, maybe you can get by without that surgery.</p>
<p>You'll want to do your homework to help you decide whether to have the
surgery or not.  You'll be warned that there's a risk of a bad outcome
of the surgery, up to and including death.  One of the significant
risks is the anesthesia, where many things can go wrong, especially for
older folks or people with concomitant medical issues.</p>
<p>For my second rotator cuff surgery, sister Debbie had sent me a review
paper on such surgeries and the objective clinical evidence was
lukewarm about the efficacy of the surgery.  After discussing this
paper's results with the surgeon Alice, I decided on the surgery after
Alice told me the only justification for having the surgery would be to
get rid of chronic pain.  That's exactly what I had and is why I chose
the third surgery.  I'm glad I did, as my chronic pain is gone (and I
had had that chronic pain for six months before the surgery -- and it
wasn't going away).</p>
<p>There may be some urgency to the surgery even though I stated elsewhere
that rotator cuff surgery isn't urgent.  For my third surgery, my
supraspinatus muscle was completely torn and Carol, the surgeon's PA,
commented that the quality of surgical repair outcomes can drop the
longer you wait.  I had waited 6 months for the surgery and Carol
commented that waiting 9 months to a year after the injury could mean a
poorer outcome or possibly a lost surgical window.  For the first
surgery (massive rotator cuff tear), Alice the surgeon told me it was a
significant injury and its repair was pretty urgent.</p>
<p>You'll experience significant pain from the surgery and it will likely
be months before you can start doing even relatively simple things
again.  If you make your living doing physical work, it can be a lot
longer before you're ready to perform your job again.  Ask your surgeon
how long you'll be off work, as this will stress you financially
because you may not have enough income.  You won't be able to drive for
4 to 6 weeks.  You'll need someone to help you with some daily
activities like getting dressed, showering, etc., at least in the first
week or two.  You also need to worry about falling, which can quickly
undo the repairs done in surgery.</p>
<p>After your surgery, simple everyday tasks can become difficult to do
with one painful arm in a sling.  For example, pulling up your pants
and tightening your belt will suddenly become a tough thing to do.
Putting on a tee shirt in the first week after surgery will be
surprisingly hard (there's a trick to it I'll mention later).  If you
injure your dominant arm, you'll have to learn to wipe yourself with
your other arm after going to the bathroom, something you may have
never done nor thought about.  However, you'll learn to accommodate and
you will get through it, so don't reject the surgery for such reasons.</p>

<div class="section" id="selecting-a-surgeon-and-therapist">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-13">Selecting a surgeon and therapist</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For my first rotator cuff tear, my family doctor Bob referred me to an
orthopedic surgeon who had operated on Bob's knee.  Unfortunately, an
appointment with him was more than three months out.  A few days after
the injury, I was on a trip out of state and visited with my sister
Debbie.  She spent an hour and a half going over the list of orthopedic
surgeons in my area that my insurance would cover.  There were about 40
of them and most she weeded out pretty quickly.  I was left with a list
of about 4 surgeons Debbie considered the best to choose from.
Debbie's experience with thousands of shoulder cases over her career
was invaluable in this selection.</p>
<p>By far the first choice on Debbie's list was Alice, both because of the
information on Alice's website and the fact that Alice had trained at a
surgical institute headed by a surgeon that Debbie knew and had worked
with in the 1970's.</p>
<p>After returning from visiting Debbie, I talked with Jimmy, one of Bob's
nurses and explained that 3 months is a pretty long wait.  I mentioned
that Alice was number one on my list and Jimmy said he'd call the
surgeon's office.  When Jimmy called me back, he said they had an
opening that afternoon because of a cancellation.  My first appointment
was with Carol, Alice's PA, and Carol went over in detail what the
diagnosis was from the MRI and what and how they would fix it.  I was
very impressed with Carol and didn't even see the surgeon Alice.  Later
that evening around 8 pm, the surgeon Alice called me and talked about
the surgery for about 20 minutes.  Alice felt the surgery was pretty
urgent because it was a massive tear.  There was a medical concern
about the surgery and Alice called my family doctor Bob to discuss it.
Bob later told me that he was impressed by Alice's concern and medical
knowledge, as they spent perhaps 15 minutes on the phone.  Bob was so
impressed with Alice that now he sends all his shoulder patients to
Alice -- and Bob told me his simple reason is &quot;they all get better&quot;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most folks won't have an expert resource like I did to
help with selecting a surgeon.  You'll probably have to rely on the
referral from your family doctor or emergency room.  A creative person
might be able to find other ways to learn more about the different
surgeons available.  For example, I worked for decades with a friend
whose wife was a surgical nurse at a local hospital.  When I had a leg
fracture in the 1980's that needed a surgical repair, I bounced the
name of the surgeon off my friend, who asked his wife about the
surgeon's reputation and I got useful feedback that helped me with the
decision.</p>
<p>You may have a friend who is associated with someone in the health care
industry.  Use such contacts if you can, as getting first-hand
knowledge can be helpful in making a decision.  You won't get such
information by looking at surgeon's websites, as you'll only see
carefully-written marketing information).</p>
<p>Something I know now is that I would gladly pay someone for their time
for their professional advice to help me with this surgical
decision/selection.  For example, I'd contact my PT Eve and pay her for
some of her time to help me decide on a surgeon.  The PTs will know and
have worked with a number of surgeons and may be willing to give you
objective data or at least make a recommendation.  However, there's a
chance that they won't be perfectly frank, as a bad recommendation
might get back to a surgeon and affect that PT's future referrals.</p>
<p>Another idea could be to try to schedule 10 minutes with an orthopedic
surgeon to ask for advice on a surgeon to select for your surgery,
specifically ruling the person who you're talking to out as a candidate
surgeon.  Present them with the question of who they would ask to
operate on their spouse or child.  I don't know if such things are
done, but it can't hurt to ask.  It might be worth your time to wander
around the orthopedic ward at a local hospital, asking folks for their
opinions.  If you're up-front, it's likely not unethical, but some
folks may not be willing to discuss such things.  Still, you'll
probably have more useful information than blindly relying on a
referral from the emergency room folks or looking surgeons up on the
web or in the phone book.</p>

<div class="section" id="gentle-pressure">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-14">Gentle pressure</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it can be hard getting an appointment with a surgeon, I suggest
gentle pressure.  A good tactic (at least before COVID) is to go into
the surgeon's office and talk to the scheduler in person if you can.
Get to know them and offer to be available for a cancellation at any
time.  Of course, this is much easier for someone like myself who is
retired.  But if you make it a priority, you may be able to get in
quickly for your first appointment.  After that, the surgeon's office
will be able to accommodate you with the follow-up appointments, as
you're now in their rotation.  Use your best people skills with the
scheduler -- you want this person on your side.</p>
<p>As an example, I needed some relatively minor abdominal surgery about 6
months after my last shoulder surgery and my shoulder surgeon Alice
recommended a surgeon in her building.  At my yearly physical, I had my
family doctor Bob make a referral to this surgeon.  The surgeon's
office called me and said the first appointment was quite a few months
out.  I chatted with the woman making the appointments and we joked
about a number of things, as she had a good sense of humor.  I
explained I was retired and could get to their office in less than 15
minutes on short notice.  In a few days, she called me back with a
cancellation, but luck would have it that it was right in the middle of
my next PT appointment.  A few days later, she called again and I got
another appointment a week later, also due to a cancellation.  I went
from many months of waiting for surgery to less than two weeks.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="preparation-for-surgery">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-15">Preparation for surgery</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your primary source of information on how to prepare for the surgery
will be the surgeon's office.  They'll provide you with printed
information that tells you the things you'll need to do.  Read such
instructions carefully.  One of the most important is to avoid food on
the day of surgery, as food in your stomach under anesthesia can result
in vomiting, which might quickly turn into a life-threatening emergency
if you breathe the vomited material into your lungs.  Another danger is
infection, so follow the cleaning and antiseptic instructions
carefully.  Thirdly, pay particular attention to what they tell you
about any medications you're taking.</p>
<p>One of the best preparations should be a careful medical history.  For
my first surgery, a nurse at the hospital spent nearly an hour and a
half taking a careful history, asking me lots of questions, and writing
it all down.  I don't believe any of this information was needed in the
subsequent surgeries, but if there was a problem, it could have been
incredibly valuable to the doctor on the spot if there was an emergency
they had to respond to.  I was grateful for the hard work and
thoroughness of this nurse taking this history.</p>
<p>For my third surgery, I was sent to a hospital in another town for a
thorough evaluation by a PA.  This PA asked me a lot of questions, took
another careful history, and had the results reviewed by an on-staff
internal medicine doctor.  Their focus was on evaluating my risks to
anesthesia and included giving me an electrocardiogram.  I was quite
impressed with the abilities and people skills of this PA.</p>
<p>The folks at the hospital gave me a surgical prep kit that contained a
soap to wash the shoulder with the night before and the morning of the
surgery.  After the morning shower, I also swabbed a disinfectant over
the surgical area.  Follow these instructions carefully, as they'll
help avoid an infection.</p>
<p>You'll also be instructed on what medications to take and not take the
day of surgery.  Again, follow these instructions carefully to make
sure you're doing what was asked of you.  Not following the
instructions nor telling the medical folks you've not followed them is
foolish and can put you at unnecessary risk.</p>
<p>For my third surgery, I was required to have a COVID19 test two days
before the surgery.</p>
<p>You may be sent to a medical supply place before your shoulder surgery
to be fitted for a sling.  Since you may spend 6 weeks in this sling,
you'll want to make sure it's fitted properly and you've gotten
instruction in its use.  If you can, spend a day or two in it before
the surgery because this will give you some hints about how your life
will be changed by the shoulder surgery.  Find out what it's like to
try to pull up your pants with one hand, get dressed (putting on socks
with one hand is challenging, but you can learn to do it), and do other
common daily activities.  Even if you do this practice, it won't be
realistic because you won't be able to simulate the pain you'll
experience when you accidentally move the arm that has had the surgery.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="surgery">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-16">Surgery</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>You'll be given a time to appear at the hospital and where to go inside
the hospital.  You'll first go through the paperwork, arrange for
payment, and go through multiple checks to identify you.  You'll be
given a wrist-band that identifies you.  Don't be surprised by the
number of times that this will be scanned and that you're asked who you
are, as these procedures have evolved from stupid mistakes made in
hospitals, such as operating on the wrong limb or doing the wrong
procedure.</p>
<p>You'll wait to go into the surgical prep area.  When they can accept
you, you'll remove all clothes and put on a hospital gown.  You'll need
to remove contact lenses, hearing aids, dental accessories, jewelry,
etc.  The nurse will take vital signs and get you ready for the
surgery.  Inserting an IV is a typical task.  I had an incredibly nice
and competent nurse for my first shoulder surgery and we joked around a
lot.  Sadly, for my next rotator cuff repair two years later, she had
retired and everyone missed her terribly because she was such a
wonderful person.</p>
<p>You'll be asked to sign a consent form for the surgery.  It will
explicitly state that the risks can include death.  These things are of
course to minimize the malpractice risks of the hospital and doctors.
If you're concerned about such things, you may want to get a copy of
the form you'll be asked to sign ahead of time.</p>
<p>An anesthesiologist will talk with you and give you a quick examination
(e.g., listen to your heart and lungs).  They will ask you about what
type of anesthesia you'd like to have.  Ask them to explain your
choices and the benefits/risks associated with each one.  For each of
my rotator cuff repairs, I asked for a nerve block (based on the advice
of my sister Debbie), which is a simple injection into a nerve nexus in
your neck.  Both of mine lasted for about 24 hours, which was great,
but I was told in the two years since my first one there are ones that
now can last even longer.  Unfortunately, the anesthesiologist who
started my treatment and explained this wasn't the one who gave me the
injection (it was right at shift change), so I only got the one day
numbing even though I asked for the multiple day numbing.  Thus, don't
be shy about verifying you're getting what you asked for.</p>
<p>To give the nerve block, the anesthesiologist alerts the nurse to
inject a quick-acting sedative into your IV.  As soon as you feel the
first sign of wooziness from this injection, the anesthesiologist will
use an ultrasound device to find the proper area for injection in your
neck.  You'll feel a slight prick from the injection, but it's over
with quickly and totally ignorable.  Interestingly, for both my left
and right shoulder surgeries, the injection was given on the right side
of my neck.</p>
<p>For my fracture surgery, I wasn't given any choices about the
anesthesia.</p>
<p>Your surgeon will visit you just before your surgery and answer any
last-minute questions.  He'll write on the shoulder to be operated on
after asking you which shoulder is to be operated on.</p>
<p>When it's time for your surgery, you'll be wheeled into the operating
room.  I was conscious and asked a lot of questions for each surgery
because I'm curious about such things.  I still remember the people in
the operating room and joking around with them.  They will ask you to
help them move you off the gurney onto the operating table, so do the
best you can with your injured arm.</p>
<p>I was a bit sedated when I was wheeled to the operating room for my
first surgery and it's a little hazy, but I was wide awake for the next
two surgeries.  For my fracture surgery, I was surprised by the number
of people in the operating room (perhaps six people) and I joked with
the x-ray tech who was wearing a gaudy Halloween lead apron, as it was
October 9th.  I particularly remember the anesthesiology nurse starting
an injection into my IV to put me under and it was surprisingly
painful, causing my whole right arm to burn.  I complained about it and
he apologized, but a few seconds later I lost consciousness.  For my
third surgery, I commented on this to one of the folks in the operating
room and even though they weren't going to use that particular method
with me, they said that they now have a way of blocking out that
initial pain.  Thus, the processes keep improving, as they should.  I
again joked around with the folks in the operating room and I remember
talking to Carol, the surgeon's PA, as she was there helping get things
ready.</p>
<p>Soon, you'll be unconscious from the anesthesia and the next thing
you'll be aware of is waking up in the recovery room.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-18">Recovering from surgery</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>After my first rotator cuff surgery, my first conscious thought when
waking up was that I was laying on my back and that someone had put a
cell phone down my throat.  I tried to say &quot;Get this cell phone out of
my throat!&quot;, but couldn't speak.  In a few seconds after waking up, it
was gone.  It was an intubation tube stuck into my trachea, as they
keep you intubated through the surgery.  I coughed a few times and then
started talking like I had a frog in my throat.</p>
<p>The nurse attending me (call him Jerry) said I instantly came awake
because he had just inserted a Foley catheter in me, which is used to
drain urine.  This was after 3 pm and I hadn't peed since early that
morning, so my bladder was full.  This was in phase 1 recovery and they
monitor you fairly closely.  When you're stable, they'll move you to
phase 2 recovery where your spouse can visit with you.  This was about
15 to 20 minutes after regaining consciousness.  A nurse's assistant,
Karl, was also present and he told me that he had just learned how to
put a patient's contact lenses in.  Karl put my lenses in and I was
much happier, as I could see things again (I'm very nearsighted).  Karl
and Jerry followed me into phase 2 recovery and my wife came in to be
with me.  She took pictures of me with her cell phone and I looked like
I had the mumps, as I was still quite swollen from the fluids injected
by the surgeon to make the surgical area easier to see by spreading the
tissues.</p>
<p>I wanted the Foley catheter out as soon as possible, as it's
uncomfortable.  Karl pulled it out and it only takes a few seconds, but
it made me yelp in pain.  What I didn't realize was that my urethra was
going to hurt for the next few days every time I had to pee.  As I was
riding the wheelchair out to leave the hospital, I stopped in the
bathroom and peed.  Oh, boy, did it hurt.  I definitely did not want to
pee and have this pain over the next couple of days, but of course you
have no choice (and I had blood in my urine for a couple of days).  At
about day 3 the pain went away and I was ecstatic for two or three days
every time I went in to pee, as there was no pain.  This experience
taught me to pee immediately before I was wheeled into the operating
room for the next two shoulder surgeries, as I didn't want a catheter
again.</p>
<p>For my two rotator cuff surgeries, I came to the hospital in the
morning and left for home in the afternoon, so they were done on an
outpatient basis.  For the fracture surgery with the larger incision,
it's typical that they'll want you to stay overnight and they'll
release you in the morning.  When you stay overnight, a nurse will come
in and monitor things every few hours, so you won't get a great night's
sleep.  An important detail is to always ring for the nurse if you want
to go to the bathroom so they can help you.  No one wants to see you
fall after your surgery.</p>
<p>Before being released from the hospital after the fracture surgery, I
had an enthusiastic physical therapist visit me and give me tips about
dealing with the surgery.  He had me walk around the ward with a
&quot;leash&quot; on so he could help me avoid a fall, as I was on opioid pain
medications at this point and they can make you wobbly.  He recommended
that I get a cane to help with walking over the next week or two, so we
stopped at a store on the way home and bought one.  It's an excellent
tool and I used it for a number of weeks, even after stopping taking
the pain medications.  I also used it many times for helping with
external rotation stretching after my third surgery.</p>
<p>After the first rotator cuff surgery, I thought I'd be hungry after the
surgery because I hadn't eaten anything since the dinner the previous
day (nearly 24 hours before), but I wasn't hungry when I left the
hospital.</p>
<p>After the surgeries with the nerve blocks, I kept feeling a piece of
metal that must have been on the sling hitting me in the stomach.  I'd
lift the loose shirt I was wearing and be surprised that it was my
thumb that kept hitting me.  My surgical arm was completely paralyzed
and had no feeling at all -- I could pinch it and not feel a thing.
That's how effective a nerve block is.</p>
<p>You'll probably have a cough from being intubated.  After my third
surgery, I had a cough for a week or two (I'd had the COVID infection 6
months before and this might have been related).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="surgical-pain">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-19">Surgical pain</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the anesthesia wears off, your surgical area is going to hurt.
Many people are surprised by the pain levels and sometimes their
surgeon doesn't prepare them well enough to expect such pain levels.
Your surgeon probably prescribed a narcotic pain medication like
oxycodone for you.  You need to understand exactly how to use these
medicines, as they can be addictive and taking too much can be fatal.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want to be on top of the pain and start your medications
before the onset of the pain.  But this is difficult to predict.  My
nerve blocks lasted about 24 hours.  I had asked for a multi-day nerve
block for my second rotator cuff surgery, but the shift change had an
anesthesiologist change and the second doctor missed the first doctor's
promise.  Thus, after about 24 hours I started to feel pain and was a
bit mystified by it, but then decided to start taking the pain
medications.  I started off with taking three 5 mg oxycodone tablets
every 4 hours, the maximum dose.  For all three surgeries, I took 15 mg
of oxycodone every 4 hours for about 12 hours.  At around 11 pm the day
after the surgery I no longer needed the pain medications.  For my
first surgery, however, I took the oxycodone at night for the next two
nights, as it helped with me getting to sleep.</p>
<p>Besides the risks of getting addicted or overdosing, there are two
other problems with opioids.  First, they can cause constipation.  Your
doctor's instructions will warn you about this and they'll recommend a
stool softener pill.  I recommend going farther than that and taking a
good dose of something like Metamucil every day.  You'll also want a
high fiber diet.  A large salad for lunch with beans and lots of
vegetables works well for me.</p>
<p>Second, the opioids can cause nausea.  This can come on quickly with no
warning.  Your doctor should also have prescribed an anti-nausea pill
like Ondansetron.  This is a small pill you dissolve under your tongue
and they work surprisingly quickly.  I had an onset of nausea a few
times after the surgeries and these anti-nausea pills are nearly
magical.  I remember a leg surgery in the 1980's and being given
morphine for it -- and throwing up violently at midnight in the
hospital room from this morphine.</p>
<p>My shoulder surgery pain levels subjectively behave in about the
following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Highest pain level was 24-30 hours after the surgery.  On a scale
of 1 to 10, I rate the worst pain levels around 6.</li>
<li>After about 1 week, the pain levels had dropped by about a factor
of 2.</li>
<li>After 2 weeks, another drop of about 2.</li>
<li>After 3-4 weeks, there was no pain unless I moved my arm.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The first week after the surgery is the hardest, the second week is
less hard but still painful.  You have to grit your teeth and just make
it through the sleeplessness and ongoing pain.  The pain will drop over
time, but it does seem to go slowly.  Just make your mind up to get
through things one day at a time.</p>
<p>Watching movies or having an involved conversation with someone are
good to help you get your mind off your pain.  I found pacing up and
down good also -- and the gentle bumping of the arm while you're
walking seemed to help, somewhat counter-intuitively.</p>
<p>It is typical for me that I am unable to do the simple passive
stretching recommended after the surgery because of the pain.  The PA
told me a week after the surgery that I could start pendulum, external
rotation, and lay on the back and raise my arm over my head (forward
flexion).  But it was too painful to do and it was a couple of weeks
before I was able to get into doing them.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sleeping">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-20">Sleeping</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your shoulder surgery is going to interrupt your sleep, possibly for
months.  I was not able to lay flat on my back for months after the
surgery because I'd develop a nerve pain in my arm (described when I
had to have the MRI procedures).  I'd instead try to sleep in my
recliner in the living room -- and often I'd have to sleep sitting up
because I couldn't recline at all.  This meant I rarely was able to
sleep for more than half an hour without waking up.  It was also
complicated by being an old geezer who has to get up and pee numerous
times a night.</p>
<p>For my first two surgeries, I believe I slept in my recliner in the
living room for about 2 months after the surgery.  In my recliner, I
couldn't sleep on my side nor fully stretch out flat.  You'll want to
periodically try to sleep in your bed again, as it will slowly get more
comfortable over time.  For my third surgery, I only needed to sleep in
the recliner for a month, then went back to my bed.  It was another two
months before I was able to sleep comfortably on my surgical shoulder.</p>

<div class="section" id="blowing-out-the-repair">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-21">Blowing out the repair</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You're at risk for multiple months after the rotator cuff surgery from
&quot;blowing out&quot; the surgical repair.  This means injuring the shoulder
again before the tissues have healed sufficiently.  The surgeon's
office will warn you about this, as surgeons/PAs and PTs see this
happen fairly frequently.  The strategic reasons to avoid it are 1) you
undo all the hard work of the surgeon, your PT, and your commitment and
2) after such a blow-out, the surgical re-repair is typically nowhere
near as good as the initial repair.</p>
<p>Clearly, an accident like a fall can easily blow out the surgery.  What
you won't appreciate, however, is that less-obvious things can do it
too.  <strong>The best strategy to avoid a blow out is to keep your arm in
your sling, properly fitted, at all times</strong>.  A non-obvious thing that
can damage the surgical repair is dropping something and instinctively
grabbing at it with the surgical arm.  It can happen so fast you won't
be aware of it.  If your arm is in a sling, it's more likely the sling
will help prevent this.</p>
<p>I often opened the sling while in my recliner to be able to rest my arm
in a different position for comfort.  After a careful caution by the PA
Carol after my third surgery about keeping my arm in the sling, I
mentally forced myself to put the sling back on <strong>EVERY</strong> time I got
out of my recliner, even if I was just going a couple of steps away.</p>
<p>Here's another non-obvious source of blow out:  if you're sleeping in
your recliner and having a dream, you may involuntarily move your
surgical arm violently during the dream.  I never had this happen, but
I've heard of it happening.  Because of this, I tried to sleep in the
recliner with the sling on, but this was often difficult because of the
nerve pain.</p>
<p>The risk of a blow out exists for quite a while, especially for tendon
repairs which take a long time to heal because of poorer blood supply.
There's no magical date where the blow out risk goes from high to low.
I suspect the risk is significant for 4 to 6 months for a routine
repair and 6 months to a year or more for a complicated repair.  Ask
your surgeon, as she'll know best.</p>

<p>In my experience, the physical therapy phase is the hardest part of a
shoulder surgery because</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It requires significant commitment and faith in the PT's judgment</li>
<li>It requires much more time than you think</li>
<li>It's a boring repetitive task that needs to be done every day</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Because it's the hardest part, I'll spend the most time on it.</p>
<p>The initial stretching and range of motion tasks had to be done twice
daily for the first three months -- and this gets old pretty quickly.
It's easy to find excuses not to do your assigned tasks.</p>
<p>A physical therapist is a person trained in a variety of treatments and
methods of helping people regain motor skills after injury or surgery
(this is a limited definition suitable for this document, although PTs
can have many other skills).  A PT's training is minimally a four year
college degree, although doctorate-level training is now the preferred
level of training as stated by the PT's professional organization.  PT
offices also employ physical therapy assistants (they typically have
two years of college training) who will also treat you under the
supervision of a PT.</p>
<p>My twin sister Debbie is a doctoral-level physical therapist.  She has
seen thousands of shoulder patients over her career and was invaluable
to me in many phone calls and visits while recovering from my
surgeries.  She has had shoulder surgery herself, so she intimately
knows what shoulder patients go through.</p>
<p>Your surgeon or her PA will issue a prescription for physical therapy,
which will define the protocols the physical therapist follows during
your treatment.  The PT will be careful to adhere to the surgeon's
instructions.  A few days to a few weeks after your surgery you'll
start seeing a physical therapist.  Your PT treatment will probably go
through the following stages:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Pain control</strong>:  If you have uncontrolled pain, you won't do
stretching or exercises, so pain needs to be dealt with first.
Your PT will have numerous techniques to try to help you with
pain.</li>
<li><strong>Passive range of motion</strong>:  Because you have been in a sling,
your tendons and muscles will tighten up and atrophy from lack of
use.  To avoid a frozen shoulder, the first focus will be on
passive stretching (passive means you don't use the injured
shoulder's muscles) to regain lost range of motion (ROM).</li>
<li><strong>AAROM</strong>:  As you progress, you'll use Active-Assisted Range of
Motion techniques, which means using your good arm to e.g. help
move your injured arm, along with partial use of the injured
arm's muscles.  You'll slowly transition to active movement,
which involves using the injured arm's muscles for the movement.
This needs to be done carefully to avoid overstressing the
repaired muscles/tendons.</li>
<li><strong>Neuromuscular retraining</strong>:  You may have learned alternative
muscle movements that accommodate your injury.  These need to be
unlearned, as they can interfere with the rehabilitation of the
muscles you should be using.  Your PT will give you specific
exercises and instructions on what to do.  Watching yourself
exercise in a mirror is an excellent feedback technique to verify
you're doing things correctly, but the best feedback comes from
the PT or PT assistant watching you do your stretching and
exercises.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening</strong>:  the last phase of rehabilitation is to regain
the lost muscle strength in the targeted muscles.  This can take
a long time, sometimes over a year.  A common focus of the PT is
to ensure you regain the needed strength and functionality to do
your common daily tasks.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For my rehab, it was typical that the first 6 weeks was focused on
stretching techniques to regain range of motion.  The next 6 weeks used
active-assisted range of motion techniques and isometric exercises
(it's still a bit early to be straining the sutures in your shoulder).
Strength training then started after 12 weeks of PT -- and started
gently.</p>
<p>PTs use many techniques to aid recovery.  I have had a number of
different treatments applied to me during a PT appointment and I have
tried to objectively evaluate them for effectiveness, at least for my
treatments.  I will give my opinions on the treatments I have had and
their effectiveness, but realize that these things can be subtle and a
technique that I didn't find effective for me might work well for you.
Thus, approach things with an open mind and look for objective
benefits.</p>
<p>PTs use heating and cooling pads to warm and cool tissues.  I found the
heating pads sometimes useful during my 8 minute warm-up period on the
&quot;shoulder bicycle&quot;.  The chilled cooling pads can be nearly magical, as
they can help relieve soreness and discomfort after stretching or
exercises.  Learn to apply them properly and you can use them as needed
at home (the key is to not let your skin temperature get too low).
Early in my PT appointments I'd be treated with a cold pad, but I
quickly decided that was something I could do myself at home and there
was no need to &quot;waste&quot; valuable PT time with something I could do
myself.</p>
<p>Two other treatments I've had are electrostimulation and ultrasonic
energy deposited in the injured tissues.  Electrostimulation involves
small currents (on the order of 5 microamperes) being passed through
muscles to make them involuntarily contract.  I've had it applied
somewhere between 10 and 15 times and I never could feel any benefit
from the treatment, so I asked that it not be used anymore.  Debbie
said there's no strong clinical evidence that it helps everyone, though
some patients feel it's beneficial.  She said she used it on herself
for her shoulder and wrist surgery therapy.</p>
<p>The principle of ultrasound seems to be that the sonic energy is
absorbed in the tissues, causing gentle heating (and maybe some
physical movement, although it will likely be tiny).  This supposedly
helps improve blood flow which should aid healing.  Physically, the
effect is probably small and I could never feel any benefit from it, so
I chose not to use it after a few trials.  An FDA <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/surgical-and-therapeutic-products/ultrasonic-therapy-product-or-ultrasonic-diathermy">site</a>
says that ultrasound can raise tissue temperatures perhaps 3 to 5
degrees C.</p>
<p>PTs will massage an incision area to help reduce the scar tissue.  They
can show you how to do this yourself.</p>
<p>The skill I most value in the PT and PT assistants is their ability to
manipulate your arm to determine your range of motion and their various
techniques of massaging and digging their fingers into trigger points.
They know all about your shoulder's state after handling it for a
minute or two and feeling the elasticity (&quot;end points&quot;) and how the
muscles/joints move.  They'll use a rotating angle gauge (called a
goniometer) to measure your range of motion and note it on your chart.
I always had them write the numbers down for both my notebook and to
send to my sister Debbie to keep her apprised of my progress.</p>
<p>Digging their fingers into trigger points is used by the PT to help
relax your shoulder muscles and improve range of motion.  The technique
is borderline uncomfortable while it's being done, but my shoulder
always felt looser and more relaxed as I left the PT's office.
Interestingly, Eve told me the insurance companies seem to value the
exercise equipment more than these hands-on skills of the PT.  Eve
spent a lot of time during my first 10 or so PT appointments digging
into my scapula, trying to get it to free up.  It tightens up
significantly while your arm is in that sling.  This is one of the
locations that's hard for the patient themselves to treat.</p>
<p>After the desired range of motion is achieved, the therapy will
transition into regaining lost strength and getting rid of learned
accommodations.  This will take more time than you think and will
probably proceed slowly per the surgeon's protocol.  Eve knew that I
was feeling able to do a bit more than she was assigning me, but she
very reasonably told me that both she and I would be fools to &quot;blow
out&quot; the surgeon's careful repair by starting an exercise a week or two
early.  My risk would be that months of twice-daily PT work would be
lost and a second surgical repair is never as effective as the first.
Her risk would be losing professional credibility with the surgeon.
Thus, we both stood to lose a lot, so we wisely stayed with the
conservative progression.  I don't regret it in the least.  I saw Alice
the surgeon a few weeks later for my last appointment with her (4
months after the surgery) and she was pleased with my progress.</p>
<p>Strengthening will start with isometric exercises and progress into
using big rubber bands called Therabands and using weights.  Both are
useful.  I like Therabands because you can adjust the level of exercise
by moving slightly.  Thus, a typical exercise is to e.g. do 40 &quot;rowing
motions&quot; in two sets of 20 with a 30 second rest between the sets.
Your goal is to start reaching muscle fatigue around the count of 16 or
18, making it tough to get those last few movements.  If you're not
fatigued enough, step away to stretch the bands slightly more and
you'll get more fatigue.  With weights, the only way to increase the
fatigue without increasing the weight is to increase the number of
repetitions or slow the movements down.  Follow the PT's advice on
which bands and weights to use and be careful not to overdo things.</p>
<p>Part of the art of the physical therapist is to 1) find methods of
treatment, stretching, and exercise that work for the patient and 2)
that the patient will do as instructed.  For example, Eve showed me 3
or 4 different ways of doing a particular stretching motion for my
shoulder and she told me to pick the one that worked best for me.  A
constant barrier to successful PT treatment is that the patients find
excuses not to do their stretches and exercises.  I understand this
perfectly, as it's time-consuming and monotonous -- and we'd rather be
doing something else.  However, by my third surgery, I was committed to
doing my stretches and exercises exactly as I was instructed because I
know that Eve knows her stuff and knows what's best for me while
following the surgeon's protocol.  I did my stretches/exercises twice a
day for 3 months, every day, only missing one afternoon because I was
outside working on chores.  Around 3 months, my exercises with weights
and Therabands changed to once per day, which is easy to get done first
thing in the morning.  If you're doing your exercises right, you'll
find your shoulder will likely be sore, but pay attention to how things
become easier week by week.  Improvement is slow, but it's noticeable.</p>
<p>A good contrast is to do your exercise or stretch with your other
(presumably good) arm periodically.  This demonstrates how much further
you need to progress.  It's also helpful to show you your progress.</p>
<p>Your PT or PT assistant can immediately see if you're doing your work,
from a variety of tells.  They can put their hands on your shoulder and
tell from the tone of the muscles.  Watching you exercise tells them a
lot at a glance, if for no other reason than how facile the exercise is
for you, indicating you've done it multiple times.  Finally,
manipulating your shoulder in soft tissue work and assessing the range
of motion and end points is the most telling of all.  Don't think that
you can fool them, as you can't.</p>
<p>After my third surgery and PT, my wife and I camped in another state
with my sister Debbie and her husband.  My sister had me take my shirt
off and evaluated me at her campsite for about 10 minutes, both pushing
with me resisting with both arms for comparisons as well as just
visually inspecting my movements.  Then she said &quot;A+, well done!&quot; --
which was high praise from her indeed, as she has high standards.  This
was the ultimate benefit of following Eve's instructions exactly and
diligently -- a normally working shoulder again.  During my recovery, I
mentioned a number of times to Debbie about my commitment and I'd get
back comments like &quot;Imagine that, a patient that does what they're told
to.&quot;  This was a clue that PTs can have a hard time convincing patients
what needs to be done and to follow their treatment plan.  But I can
honestly say they really do know what they're doing.  Find the best PT
you can and follow their instructions exactly.</p>

<div class="section" id="form">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-23">Form</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It's easy to get sloppy when doing your exercises or stretches,
particularly because they are a boring repetitive task.  Often, we
hurry through them to get them over with.  The faster you do them, the
crappier your form.</p>
<p>Another problem, particularly for those with testosterone coursing
through their system, is the attitude that if a little is good, then
more must be better.  I fell to this problem during the PT for my third
surgery, reasoning that I wasn't getting tired enough with my weights,
so I increased the weights.</p>
<p>Both my sister Debbie and the PT assistant Frank were concerned about
my descriptions of the weights I was using, much larger than they felt
appropriate for the stage I was at.  Debbie cautioned me to have a
critical evaluation of all this at my next PT appointment and Frank
watched me do my exercises.  Frank gave me some important education in
both maintaining proper form and posture while doing my PT tasks along
with how to move the weights.  Sounds simple, but I was rushing through
them.  Frank had me slow way down and feel the exercise I was getting
by moving slowly.  <strong>I got a thorough workout with half the weight</strong>.
In fact, for the first three days after this review I only did 20
repetitions with the halved weight, then changed to 30 for the next
three days and planned to go to 40 on 7 days later.  However, on the
sixth day, the exercises felt good enough that I did 40 repetitions a
day early.</p>
<p>A key principle I had missed was that both Debbie and Frank wanted me
doing the movements with the weight over my full range of motion.  With
the heavier weight, I couldn't move as far and in fact would have been
<strong>losing</strong> strength over my full range of motion.</p>
<p>One of the best feedback techniques besides being watched by a PT or
her assistant is to watch yourself in a mirror.  I also found to get
good form that it was helpful to back up to a wall and touch my head
and shoulders to the wall, telling me with tactile feedback that I was
using good posture.  Another thing I had to focus on was to consciously
make sure I wasn't shrugging my shoulders, something you will do
unconsciously.</p>
<p>You can use parallax to tell when you're moving when you shouldn't be.
For example, when I do Theraband exercises, I use the edge of a door
jamb in relation to a wall feature farther away.  If these two things
move with respect to each other when I'm exercising, I'm moving my body
in an inappropriate way.</p>

<div class="section" id="discouragement">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-24">Discouragement</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not hard to get discouraged by the long rehabilitation time and
constant pain of a shoulder surgery.  My first rotator cuff surgery was
to fix a massive tear where essentially all the muscles in my left
shoulder were torn and my biceps tendon was broken.  Alice the surgeon
said it was a challenging arthroscopic repair that took 3 hours.  She
placed 7 posts into the bones to provide suture anchors for the repair
of the torn tissues.  Three months after this surgery (end of September
2018) I accidentally fell on the arm after getting cramps in both of my
calf muscles, fracturing my left humerus.  I chose to have ORIF (open
reduction internal fixation) surgery that realigned the fractured bone
and used metal plates and 13 screws to fix the pieces back together
again so they could heal.  This needed a 125 mm shoulder incision and
the biceps tendon repair needed a 25 mm incision.  During my surgical
prep for the fracture, the anesthesiologist who handled me during the
first surgery was next to me and he remembered my surgery from three
months before, commenting that he was quite concerned about my
breathing after the surgery was over because of all the fluids needed
to be used to inflate the surgical areas for good viewing of the
complicated surgery (I mentioned above I looked like I had the mumps in
the recovery room).</p>
<p>The fracture and its recovery of course interrupted the recovery of the
first rotator cuff surgery and I was again in a sling for 6 weeks.  My
PT for this extended to a bit more than a year after the first surgery.
Eve commented that this double injury/surgery was one of the more
challenging cases she has managed.</p>
<p>Around 7 months of PT after the fracture, I was still experiencing
significant shoulder pain and I had slacked off on my PT exercises,
reasoning that it couldn't be good to be doing the exercises if it
still hurt.  Around this time I visited my sister Debbie and she said I
had unfortunately regressed since she had last seen me a few months
before.  If I was her patient, she would encourage me to adopt an
intense and dedicated PT program for 2 months to recover what I had
lost.  She said I'd have about 50% shoulder functionality if I stopped
where I was.  With an intense 2 month program, I might be able to get
around 80% functionality.</p>
<p>She explained that I was <strong>long</strong> past the time the tissues should have
healed, which is considered to be about 3 months.  She had me read a
book called &quot;Explain Pain&quot; by David Butler and Lorimer Moseley,
Noigroup Publications, Australia, 2003.  This pain was a learned
response because my brain was trying to protect my body from the
multiple traumas (four:  tear, fracture, and two surgeries).  If I
wanted to regain about an 80% shoulder, I was going to have to commit
to this intensive 2-month repeat of PT to get past this point,
strengthen my arm, and regain some of the functionality I had lost
because I had slacked off on my PT program.  I chose to make the
commitment, going to PT appointments with Eve or her assistant twice
per week.</p>
<p>One of the key things I learned was I had to tell my brain over and
over again that this pain is not real.  I literally had to ignore the
pain -- which is hard to do.  Sure enough, over time the pain went
away.  This was a most surprising and unexpected lesson.  Now that I'm
writing this more than two years later, I would say that I regained
more than 90% of my left shoulder functionality, maybe nearly all of it
(maybe not quite all of the pre-injury strength, however).  This is
both a testament to the surgeon Alice's and her PA Carol's skills and
the PTs' skills (Debbie and Eve).  Also, don't underestimate the
importance of you making that commitment and sticking with it.</p>

<div class="section" id="living-with-one-arm">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-26">Living with one arm</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>With a shoulder injury, you suddenly have to figure out how to do
things with (mostly) one arm.  With a torn rotator cuff before surgery,
you'll probably find that there are some movements you can't do at all,
either because of loss of function or pain.  After surgery or a
fracture is repaired, you won't want to move your injured arm because
of the pain.  What used to be simple isn't simple anymore.</p>
<p>Many of the things you do with two hands can be done with one, although
you do them more slowly.  Others, like opening a ziplock bag, require
shoulder muscles of two arms and are things you won't be able to do.
You either find a way to accommodate (e.g., use your teeth) or ask
someone to do it for you.</p>
<p>Pulling up your pants after using the toilet can be challenging, but
you'll find you can do it with one arm.  The thing you won't be able to
do is tighten a regular belt, so you may want to find pants with an
elastic waist.  A few weeks to a month or so after your surgery, you
may find that you can tie a drawstring fairly easily, so that's another
choice.  The type of belts with two &quot;D&quot; rings is one type you can
tighten and loosen with one hand.  Ask your PT for advice, as they'll
have dealt with these things.</p>
<p>As time goes on, you'll find that you can utilize the injured shoulder
a little more.  For example, unscrewing a lid from a container that has
already been open may only require the injured arm to hold things
lightly on the counter, and this suddenly becomes doable.  Opening a
sealed container might take lots more time because it requires more
force.</p>
<p>Getting dressed is one of the daily challenges.  For a few days after
my shoulder fracture, I couldn't bend over and could barely even sit
down because of the pain, so I had to have my wife help me dress (I had
to live with the fracture for 10 days before it could be surgically
repaired).  For the first week after rotator cuff surgery, I wore
shirts my wife had slit up the seam on the injured shoulder side and
these were easy to put on with one hand (buttoning with one hand was a
little harder, but it can be done).  Putting on underpants or pants can
be a bit of a challenge -- a good tactic is to sit down and just slowly
work things on with one hand.  Getting elasticized socks on with one
hand is tricky, but can be done if you put your good hand inside the
sock and then use it to help start the toes.</p>
<p>Eve showed me a trick for putting a tee shirt on:  hang the injured arm
down in the pendulum position and slide the corresponding sleeve up
over the injured arm with your good arm.  Once you've got it over the
injured shoulder, you can pop your head through, then the other arm
(sit down if you're still wobbly or on pain medications).  Then put
your sling on over the tee shirt.  As soon as I learned this, I quit
wearing the shirts with the slit seam, as I liked the tee shirts
better.</p>
<p>My first rotator cuff surgery was near the end of June, so my recovery
was during warm summer weather.  My fracture surgery was near the
beginning of October, so I needed to wear a pile jacket for more
warmth.  I'd stick my right (good) arm through its sleeve, then use my
teeth to pull the elasticized cuff over my hand.  I'd then drape the
rest of the jacket over the injured left arm and sling (this requires a
bit of fiddling).  I had my wife pull the unused sleeve inside the
jacket so it wouldn't catch on things.  I wasn't able to zip the jacket
up, so colder weather would require a different method (again, ask your
PT for advice on what to do).  For going out in the rain, consider a
poncho, as it should be easy to put on with one hand.</p>
<p>In March of 2019, my wife accidentally tripped on something in the
garage and her fall broke the upper part of her humerus (the same
fracture I had).  She was first seen at an urgent care facility on a
Saturday evening at around 7:30 pm.  They put her in a cheap
ambidextrous sling to hold her arm steady, but it wasn't an overly
comfortable sling.  We got in to see my surgeon and her PA the
following Monday and they wanted a CAT scan to go along with the urgent
care x-rays.  After the scan, my wife was able to get a shoulder sling
similar to the one I had for my shoulder.  These were more comfortable
than the cheap slings.  A woman's breast can be compressed by the
folded arm in the sling, so she'll want to ask about ways to
accommodate this additional inconvenience, particularly since she won't
be able to put on a bra.  The PA and surgeon decided the best treatment
for her was 6 weeks in a sling, as there wasn't significant
displacement of the bone.  She was out of her sling in 6 weeks and
started physical therapy with the same PT I used.</p>

<div class="section" id="pt-in-the-morning">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-27">PT in the morning</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing your PT stretching and exercising is often a boring, repetitive
task -- especially if you have to do things twice a day.  My PT Eve
seemed to load me with enough tasks to take about 45 minutes to an
hour.  PTs know that if they load the patient too much, they won't do
their tasks, so part of the PT art is figuring out what each patient
will handle and what works best for them.  Eve would always laugh when
she gave me a new task, as she knew I would negotiate to eliminate
something else from the list.</p>
<p>One challenge is to figure out ways to keep yourself motivated to do
your assigned tasks.  By my third shoulder surgery, my motivation came
from knowing that if I didn't do the work, I wouldn't get the result.</p>
<p>Another motivation for me was to try to do my exercises first thing in
the morning, particularly when I had advanced to only needing to do
exercises once per day.  I would also do the exercises I disliked the
most first.  The mental &quot;trick&quot; I was playing on myself was to get
things out of the way early in the day so I felt good about getting the
task done and I didn't fret about it hanging over my head.</p>

In doing boring repetitive tasks like your PT exercises, it's easy to
let your mind wander and lose count.  One method I used to avoid this
was to count in units of 10 and use objects in the room as markers.
For example, 40 repetitions is a common exercise assignment.  When
doing my exercises in our hallway, I'd use the four door panels in our
laundry room door for this purpose, shifting my vision to the one I
just completed.</blockquote>

<p>When I got new PT assignments, I'd write down the new assignments in my
surgery logbook (kept in a computer document).  This was usually done
from memory, but I'd supplement it with the web-based service that Eve
used to illustrate the exercises.  It's good to review those every once
in a while to ensure you're doing things correctly.  The log is useful
to make sure you don't forget something, as I'd print the log out and
tape it to the wall for review the first few days of a new set of
exercises.  After a few days, it becomes a habit and you don't need the
printout anymore.</p>
<p>I also kept track of my ROM and AROM measurements to send to my sister
Debbie so she could keep up on how I was doing.</p>

<div class="section" id="showering">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-30">Showering</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A priority is not to slip in the shower, as you'll have your sling off.
Get a rubber mat for good traction or sit in a shower chair.</p>
<p>You'll have to soap yourself with one hand.  Some people like pump soap
for this, but I just use a bar of soap.  The only area I can't wash
easily is the armpit of the non-surgical shoulder.  After a couple of
weeks, I was able to just stick the bar of soap in the armpit with my
surgical arm and was able to rub the arm around a bit to get things
clean.  It gets easier over time.</p>
<p>Drying off with one hand is challenging at first.  I first squeegee
myself off with my good hand to remove as much water as possible after
turning the shower off.  Then I dry myself with one hand.  To do my
back, I toss the towel over my back and rub against the door frame like
a bear scratching against a tree.  I put the toilet lid down and put a
hand towel on top of the seat to dry my butt.  I sit down and dry both
legs with one hand.  This works surprisingly well and there's no danger
of slipping or losing your balance when bending over to dry your legs
when standing (the older folks will understand this).  You can also put
your underwear on while sitting on the toilet lid.</p>

<div class="section" id="sling">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-31">Sling</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The sling's purpose is to keep shoulder/arm immobilized so it can heal.
Be careful while the nerve block is still blocking the pain to not
accidentally bump and move the injured arm.  Note the arm and hand will
be paralyzed and you won't be able to move them until the block wears
off.  After the block wears off, you'll quickly learn you don't want to
bump that arm because it hurts.</p>
<p>You will probably get a sling for your arm before the surgery.  Try to
get it a week or so before the surgery so you can practice with it.</p>
<p>This practice will be valuable.  You will find out what it's like
trying to live with only one functional hand/arm.  Some daily tasks
you'll need to do are pee, wipe, pull your pants up, get dressed, put
socks and shirts on, put in your contacts and hearing aids, put on your
makeup, comb your hair, use your phone and computer, eat, etc.  This
practice is doubly important if the arm getting the surgery is your
dominant arm.  I recommend wearing the sling for practice for at least
24 hours; 48 is even better.  Put a sock over the sling hand to remind
you that you are unable to use it.  You'll of course cheat, but you'll
find out after the surgery that your arm is either paralyzed or too
painful to use, so the cheating will cost you some learning.</p>
<p>My first two surgeries were for my left (non-dominant) arm, but my
third surgery was on my right arm.  While I didn't wear the sling ahead
of time, I wish I did, as it would have prepared me a little better.</p>
<p>One important reason to wear the sling constantly and firmly is to
avoid blowing out the surgery.  As pain levels drop, you'll probably
want to get a little more casual about keeping the arm in the sling.
Both my sister and the surgeon's PA have told me they've seen way too
many people blow out their surgeries by not wearing their slings
properly.  An example of what can happen is they are carrying something
and drop it, then react to catch it with the injured arm -- this
happens fast because it's a reflex.  Then they've strained those
repairs that are supposed to be healing.  Surgical outcomes after
blowing out the first repair are much less successful than the original
surgery.  Another way of blowing the repair is tripping or falling and
pulling the arm out of the sling and falling on it.  I know I mentioned
blowing out the repair before, but it's really worth repeating.  Your
surgeon, PA, and PT will all agree.</p>
<p>Note:  with a violent event like tripping and falling, the sling may
not protect you.  A web page I read made the important point that the
sling helps you reduce all the little motions and uses you'll make with
that injured arm as it gets better.  You say you won't, but it will
terribly difficult not to, as your brain will reason that since it
doesn't hurt, it's OK.  But what you're doing is applying small
repeated forces to the repairs and these can cause cumulative damage
(it's called creep and can slowly enlarge the suture holes through the
tendons).</p>
<p>Make sure the sling is adjusted properly.  For my third surgery, the
place I got the sling had a woman who knew exactly what to do and
fitted the sling to me perfectly.</p>
<p>Small sling adjustments can make a big difference in pain levels in the
first week after surgery.  Eve's eye (my PT) spotted a problem the
first time I saw her and she was instrumental in lowering my pain
levels.  On my third surgery, my wife's eye was good at looking at the
sling and deciding on when an adjustment was needed (she had also worn
a sling when she had broken her arm).</p>
<p>On my sling, there's a top cover that uses Velcro to secure your
forearm into the sling.  On the second day after surgery, I had stopped
the opiate pain pills the night before, as I don't take them unless I
really need them.  My arm was in a lot of pain, particularly in my
elbow area.  This pain was similar to the nerve pain I get in the arm
when having an MRI with an injured shoulder -- and after 25 minutes of
laying perfectly still, this pain can reach level 6 or 7.  The
surgeon's nurse suggested taking the arm out of the sling while sitting
in my chair and resting it on a pillow.  When I opened up the sling, I
found that it had been fastened far too tightly at the hospital and I
had a large groove in my arm from the pressure of the sling.  This
relieved the pressure and things felt a lot better in a half hour or
so.  I keep this piece of Velcro open when I'm typing on my computer or
loosely connected otherwise.</p>
<p>Later, I talked with Carol, the surgeon's PA and mentioned that for my
first two surgeries, my sling was put on incorrectly with a twist in
the back, causing a plastic ring to dig into my back.  It wasn't
horrible, but the discomfort increased over a couple of days.  Carol
told me the recovery room nurses were responsible for this stuff and
often they don't do it because they're too busy.  It doesn't really
matter who's at fault -- it's important for you to be aware of fit
problems and have someone knowledgeable about it to check things.  I
feel the PT is the best person for this task.</p>
<p>The sling hardware may bug you where it protrudes, especially if you
sit for long periods.  Get a thicker shirt or insert a pad or some
foam.  The plastic clips may poke you under certain conditions.  On one
sling there were some stiff fibers that would stick me sometimes and I
used a razor blade to trim them.  My last sling hasn't had any of these
problems.</p>
<p>When sitting, you'll probably be allowed to remove the top clip of the
sling to take your arm out and e.g. rest it on a pillow (this may be
too painful in the first few days, but you'll find you really like
doing it -- or just resting your arm stretched out).  The sling design
I have is poorly designed to get the clip reconnected, which you always
want to do when you get out of the chair.  If you're handy in the shop,
there are aids that can be made to help with this and stiffen the
floppy clips, but you'll want to do this before your surgery.  This is
where practicing wearing the sling a few days ahead of the surgery will
pay off.</p>
<p>About a week after the surgery, I was able to lightly use the hand on
the arm with the surgery.  The surgeon's PA told me light-duty tasks at
waist level were OK, but no lifting or weights more than 1 pound.  You
actually can take a load of a pound or a few pounds by putting the load
in your hand and letting the sling support your wrist to take the load.
But be careful, as it's too easy to make a mistake because you will
probably use your shoulder muscles unconsciously.</p>
<p>Talk to your surgeon and PT about sling use.  Search the web for advice
too.</p>
<p>Because my sister and the surgeon's PA emphatically told me about the
risks of blowing the surgery and emphasized keeping my arm in the sling
for the first 6 weeks, I made a mental commitment to always keep the
sling on if I wasn't in my recliner.  You have to consciously make this
commitment and remember it <em>every</em> time until it becomes habit, as you
don't want to have that first accident and blow out the surgery.</p>
<p>You'll likely be a passenger in a car while in your sling.  Here's what
I learned to do while my wife and I went on a 7 hour trip:  I put the
lap part of the seat belt over my injured arm.  This would trap my arm
in a collision and hopefully would keep it from moving violently
forward in a crash.  This might mean the surgery doesn't get blown out.
I don't know enough about traffic safety and crash mechanics to know
whether this would be recommended or not by a knowledgeable engineer,
but it makes sense in my mind and it's what I do.</p>
<p>Your surgeon will tell you how long you'll have to use the sling.  For
my three surgeries, the length was 6 weeks for each one.  You won't be
allowed to drive while you're supposed to be wearing the sling.  <strong>If
you do choose to drive, you may find your insurance company will not
cover you in an accident because you went against doctor's orders</strong>.</p>
<p>For non-emergency driving, you can drive one-handed if you're careful
(most of us do it a lot).  The problem is that in an emergency, you may
not be able to react quickly or assertively enough with one hand,
particularly if the car doesn't have power steering.  If you have to
drive a lot after you're out of the sling and your surgeon tells you
it's OK, you may want to get a written release from him to ensure you
have insurance coverage in case of an accident.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-32">Ice</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Careful use of ice is important (something Debbie told me over and
over).  Get a good ice bag from your PT and have your PT show you how
to safely use ice to reduce the discomfort of the surgery, swelling, or
pain from exercising.  The basic technique is to use cloth like a towel
between the ice bag and your skin.  Your basic objective is to not let
the skin temperature get too cold.  My technique was to use an IR
thermometer and not let my skin temperature get below 20 degrees C.
Ask your PT what their technique is.</p>
<p>I don't recommend the ice chests with an electric pump that circulate
cold water through a shroud you put over your injured area.  They are a
pain to set up, 5 to 10 times more expensive than a good ice bag, and
actually less effective (I had one a friend gave me and only used it a
few times because it was a lot of work to get set up -- just what a
surgical patient is <strong>not</strong> going to want to do).  I remember the PT
charged me $20 for an ice bag and it has been a superb tool worth far
more than what it cost.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-33">Overuse</a></h2>
<blockquote>
It's common to start using your shoulder when you start to feel better,
even when you're still in your sling.  I had to learn the hard way not
to do this.  First, it can cause pain and it may not be obvious it's
due to this use.  Second, it can stress the sutures, causing loosening
because you're gently damaging the non-healed tissues.  The best
strategy is to stay in the sling religiously for the first 6 weeks,
both for protection from sudden movements and as a reminder that you
shouldn't be moving that arm.</blockquote>
